# Physical-Activity-Monitoring

## Introduction

The PAMAP2 Physical Activity Monitoring dataset contains data of 18 different physical activities (such as walking, cycling, playing soccer, etc.), performed by 9 subjects wearing 3 inertial measurement units and a heart rate monitor. The dataset can be used for activity recognition and intensity estimation, while developing and applying algorithms of data processing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification.
